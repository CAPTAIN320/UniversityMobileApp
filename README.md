# UniversityMobileApp
### A simple university mobile application with the most basic features. This project features Al-hikmah University, Ilorin as case study and is in NO way associated with the University.
It is built using HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, JqueryMobile, Google Map API and XML and can be compiled using Adobe PhoneGap.

The Al-Hikmah University mobile application is an initiative to improve the mobile experience of students, staff, and the general public who are interested in interacting with Al-Hikmah University services.
We’ve created it to make it easier for you to access campus services and resources on the go.
Whether you’re a current or prospective student, graduate or fan, we hope this app will help you out.
Features include:
-	Access Student Portal
-	Make Enquiries
-	Academic Calendar
-	Map Services
-	Latest News
-	Get Directions
-	GPA Calculator
-	Admissions Portal
We will continue to develop, expand and improve this application. 
We welcome your ideas and feedback.
